# CZ4034_Movie_Query_System_Ranked_By_Written_Reviews
This project is a movie query system for movies in https://www.imdb.com/ 

The typical way that movies are ranked on websites are according to numeric consumer ratings (usually in the form of stars on a five-point scale).
As such, the consumer sentiments as expressed in written reviews do not contribute to the ranking. 
However, written reviews contain significant information about the consumer sentiments, perhaps even more than the numeric star ratings because of the amount of time and thought that consumers put into crafting the review to best reflect their sentiments.
Furthermore, numeric reviews may be an inaccurate reflection of the true sentiment towards a movie because a numeric scale may be subjective to individuals. For example, two separate individuals who agree that the movie is 'good' may give numeric star ratings of 4 and 5 respectively, and the discrepency is never accounted for in the system.
Hence, in this project, a new rating system which captures the consumer sentiments in written reviews is proposed (to complement the existing widely-used numeric star ratings), which can be used to generate a different ranking result from a given query.
